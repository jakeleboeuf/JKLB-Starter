=================

# Description #
This is a starter web build template thingy put together by [Jake LeBoeuf](http://jklb.co) for building a static web project using the Compass Framework and SASS on top of the HTML5 Boilerplate 2.0.

## Feel free to use this ##
Compass and SASS related files are in the /compass folder.
The config file is set up to be ready to go. You should use codekit.

### CSS (/css) ###
The base CSS file (/css/style.css) is pre-compiled using the HTML5 Boilerplate approved normalize.css. If compass is watching the /compass/sass folder then all your edits will truncate over styles.css so you should not be touching it at all, only editing from the scss files.

### JavaScript (/js) ###
Libraries are stored in the /js/libs folder, including jQuery 1.9.1 and Modernizr 2.6.2. 

### Image Files (/img) ###
Images are stored in the /img. You can create additional folders for the fancy Compass spriting engine to do the work for you (after a @import "sprites/*.png" in base stylesheet)!
